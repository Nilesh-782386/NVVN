# CareConnect - Improved Workflow Implementation

## 🚀 New Smart Donation Matching System

### Overview
Transformed CareConnect from a basic platform to a **SMART donation matching system** with NGO competition, priority-based routing, and streamlined workflows.

---

## 📋 New Workflow

### 1. **Donor Side**
- Donor registers/logs in
- Creates donation request with **priority selection**:
  - 🔴 **Critical**: Food, Medicines, Urgent Needs
  - 🟠 **High**: Clothes, Blankets, School Kits  
  - 🟡 **Medium**: Books, Toys, Non-urgent items
  - 🟢 **Low**: Books, Toys, Non-urgent items
- Request saved with `status = "pending_approval"`
- Donor tracks status updates

### 2. **NGO Side** 
- NGO logs in with unique credentials
- **Sees ALL donation requests in their city** (not limited to their NGO)
- **Competition model**: Multiple NGOs can see the same request
- **Approve/Reject** based on requirements:
  - **Approve** → Request assigned to that NGO, status becomes `assigned`
  - **Reject** → Request remains visible to other NGOs
- **Priority-based sorting**: Critical requests appear first

### 3. **Volunteer Side**
- Volunteer logs in
- **Sees only approved requests for their NGO**
- **Priority-based assignment**: Critical requests get first attention
- Accepts request → Picks up → Delivers → Uploads proof
- Status updates: `assigned` → `picked_up` → `in_transit` → `delivered`

### 4. **Admin Side**
- Monitors all NGOs, Donors, and Volunteers
- Generates reports on city-wise requests, approvals, deliveries
- Ensures transparency and fair tracking

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### New Columns Added to `donations` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE donations 
ADD COLUMN priority ENUM('critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low') DEFAULT 'medium',
ADD COLUMN ngo_approval_status ENUM('pending', 'approved', 'rejected') DEFAULT 'pending';

-- Updated status enum
ALTER TABLE donations 
MODIFY COLUMN status ENUM('pending_approval', 'assigned', 'picked_up', 'in_transit', 'delivered', 'completed', 'rejected') DEFAULT 'pending_approval';
```

### New Indexes for Performance:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_donations_ngo_approval ON donations(ngo_approval_status, city);
CREATE INDEX idx_donations_priority ON donations(priority);
```

## 📊 Example Flow

**Donor Riya** donates 10 food packets (Critical priority)
↓
**Pune city** has 3 NGOs → all 3 see this request
↓
**NGO "FoodForAll"** approves it → request marked as High Priority
↓
**Volunteer Amit** (from FoodForAll) accepts → picks up → delivers
↓
**Proof uploaded** → status updates to Delivered
↓
**Donor Riya** sees delivery status on dashboard
